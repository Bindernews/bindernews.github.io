So you're curious about me or this website?<br>

## QYMA (Questions You Might Ask)
**Q:** Why did you make this site?<br>
**A:** I needed a reason to learn HTML and CSS. Thus I began work on this website.

**Q:** Why "vortexel.com" when you refer to yourself as Binder News?<br>
**A:** For a long time I ran a Minecraft server and it was named Vortexel.
For that reason I own vortexel.com. Since then I have started using
the username Vortan as well as Binder News. You may refer to me as either.

**Q:** How did you learn to program?<br>
**A:** I am self-taught. My first programming langauge was Java and I honestly
didn't use anything except the few pieces of example code I had at the time
and some more examples I found online.

**Q:** What "programming languages" are you familiar with?<br>
**A:** In no particular order: Java, C, C++, Python, Javascript, Bash, Lua, C#,
Z80 Assember, TI-Basic, Ruby, Axe, AWK, and a few others you've never heard of.
You can find out more about various languages [here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer).

**Q:** Why did you put "programming languages" in quotes and what did you just link me to?<br>
**A:** Because not all of them are general languages. Some are very domain-specific.
As for the link it takes you to Rosetta Code which is a site with various tasks.
People implement a task in a given language and submit it. Then other people can go
to the page and use the examples to learn new programming languages. It's pretty cool.

**Q:** How long have you been programming?<br>
**A:** I started programming in the summer of 2008. At the time of this writing
that is at least 7 years.

**Q:** What else do you do?<br>
**A:** When I'm not programming I enjoy thinking about programming. I also play TF2
and a few other video games but I'm not a hardcore gamer. I enjoy singing and playing
games with friends.

**Q:** How do I verb?<br>
**A:** You don't. You adjective instead.

**Q:** I want to talk to you / hire you / ask a question. How do I get in touch?<br>
**A:** I'm flattered! You can email me at [contact@vortexel.com](mailto:contact@vortexel.com).
